# Scuffed-Google

## Inspiration

We were inspired to develop a new discord meme bot to meet our needs as Stony Brook students, with functionality designed to entertain and keep us sharp.

## What it does

A multifaceted discord bot that saves time creating memes, primarily through automated video editing -- It can deep fry and caption videos as we see fit, saving plenty of rendering time for the same procedures. We also have a discord meme database that the bot pulls from and sends when the user requests it. In addition it keeps us sharp entertained through its trivia and easy search functionality

## How we built it

We used DiscordPy to host the discord bot, FFMPEG for video editing, CSV for trivia, and Selenium for search functionality

## Challenges we ran into

Figuring out the FFMPEG documentation and learning how to use the different filters to create a result similar to what can be achieved through an editor. However through much trial and error we pulled through.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Building such a verbose video automation functionality in such little time.

## What we learned

We learned how to better use CSV, Discordpy, FFMPEG, and Selenium. Beforehand we had almost no idea how selenium worked or how to google with it, nor did we know how to write a trivia function for a discord bot, leading us to have to rewrite the code twice to fit it with the discord API.

## What's next for Scuffed

We will develop a more verbose meme database, and improve the video editing capabilities beyond just deep frying. The trivia questions will also be greatly expanded.

## Built With

Python, DiscordPy, Selenium, CSV, FFMPEG, .ENV
